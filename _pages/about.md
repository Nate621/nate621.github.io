Hi there! My name is Nathan Kassai. I am an undergraduate researcher at DASL—Drones and Autonomous Systems Laboratory—at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I love all things robotics and video games; sometimes I get a chance to combine my love for both in the work I do by using Unity to create Virtual Reality Interfaces for Robots. On my website, I have some cool projects of stuff I've done in the past, take a look around!
